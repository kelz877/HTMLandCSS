                <h3>How did I get here?</h3>
                <p>I lived in Denver, Colorado for 10 years and wanted a change. 
                I was feeling unfulfilled at work and like I was not reaching my full potential. I was googling my grandmother who is a decently 
                well-known artist in some circles and I was shocked at the state of her website. I realized that I thought I could help her build something 
                better and began learning how to try and do that. The best way for me to help out was to enroll in a bootcamp and change the path my life was going down.
                I was struggling learning on my own and found DigitalCrafts in Houston and decided that I wanted to make the jump.</p>
