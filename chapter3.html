                <h3>Project Ideas</h3>
                <ol class="lists">
                    <li>Website for art business. As I mentioned in Chapter Two, I became interested in software development after I realized that my grandmother
                        (who is an artist), had not updated her website in YEARS. This means she cannot sell any of her artwork online and is losing out on potential
                        sales as she is only able to sell through local galleries.</li>
                    <li>Scuba Website that scrapes individual business pages and returns prices and reviews all in one place. I go diving once or twice a year,
                        and there isn't really any site like this out there. If you don't already have a dive shop in mind, typically you start on TripAdvisor, 
                        navigate to the dive shop home page, and then look for costs there. My idea is to have a pge that allows you to input (at a minimum) 
                        location and then return to you dive shop names with TripAdvisor (or some other review site) reviews and then the costs from the dive shop 
                        page.</li>
                    <li>App that tracks good and bad habits and then allows you to reward yourself at the end of a certain time period. So, if you are trying to stop smoking,
                        you are able to  pick a start date and then record however many cigarettes you had each date after that and keep track of your progress.
                        Can also prompt you to do your habits like making the bed. Set a push notification to your phone to ask if you made your bed today. </li>
                </ol>
